# noPerfection Configuration

This package defines the static JSON configuration model for a noPerfection topology. It contains Go types, JSON marshal/unmarshal helpers, `Load`, `NoPerfection.Save`, and validation. It does not run a topology server or client.

## Topology Model

The config describes a topology as a graph.

- A `Service` is a node in the graph.
- A `Handler` is an entry point on that node.
- A `DepService` is an edge declaration: it says which other nodes a handler or command may call.
- A `ServicePointer` is the target of that edge, either by reference or as an inline nested service.

This separation keeps identity, transport, and routing independent:

- `Service` owns deployment metadata such as `module-url` and `start-command`.
- `Handler` owns endpoint metadata such as protocol type, category, and address.
- `DepService` owns dependency intent without embedding the target service into every caller.
- `ServicePointer` lets the same dependency point to a shared service or define an inline private service.

```

See [examples/app-proxy-chain.json](examples/app-proxy-chain.json) for a complete graph.

## Root Config

`NoPerfection` is the JSON document root. It contains the services that can be resolved by name and validated as one topology.

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "type": "Independent",
      "name": "public_api",
      "handlers": []
    }
  ]
}
```

`Load` reads this document into a JSON mycelium and validates the whole graph. `Save` mineralizes the mycelium back to indented JSON on disk.

## Mycelium Storage

Topology data is stored as a [Mushroom](https://github.com/ahmetson/mushroom) JSON mycelium, not as a direct Go slice. `Load` digests the file through `json_substrate`. All config access — reads and writes — goes through **dereference** Mushroom URLs (`?*var=`) via `Spore`/`Fruit` for queries and `Graft`/`Inoculate`/`Prune` for mutations.

```text
pkg:$?*var=services
```

`$` is a wildcard that fills in type, package, and module from the loaded file URL. For a file loaded as `pkg:json/tmp#app.json`, `pkg:$?*var=services` resolves against that mycelium.

Link URLs (`?var=` without `*`) are not used by this package. Mushroom's `Link()` API resolves symbolic paths to absolute link strings; topology config does not call it for service queries or mutations.

Plain service names passed to `GetService` are shorthand for a dereference name filter on that array:

```text
auth_proxy  →  pkg:$?*var=services[name:auth_proxy]
```

See the [Mushroom README](https://github.com/ahmetson/mushroom) for URL syntax, filters, and built-in calls such as `first()` and `last()`.

## Querying Services

### `GetService(mushroomURL)`

Resolves a dereference Mushroom URL with `Spore`, embeds nested links with `Fruit`, and decodes the result into `Service`. If the value is not a service, it returns an error.

```go
// Shorthand by service name
service, err := app.GetService("auth_proxy")

// Explicit dereference Mushroom URL
service, err := app.GetService("pkg:$?*var=services[name:auth_proxy]")

// First Independent service
service, err := app.GetService("pkg:$?*var=services[type:Independent][$.first()]")
```

### `GetServices(mushroomURL)`

Same query flow as `GetService`, but expects an array and returns `[]Service`. Pass a dereference URL (`*var`). If the resolved value is not an array of services, the URL is fetching the wrong data.

```go
// All root services
services, err := app.GetServices("pkg:$?*var=services")

// Filter by type
services, err := app.GetServices("pkg:$?*var=services[type:Independent]")

// Proxy outbounds on a named handler
services, err := app.GetServices(
    "pkg:$?*var=services[name:auth_proxy].handlers[category:main].outbounds",
)
```

### `CountByType(mushroomURL)`

Calls `GetServices` and returns the length of the result.

```go
count, err := app.CountByType("pkg:$?*var=services[type:Proxy]")
```

### `Services()` (topology layer)

The topology handler exposes `Services()` as a convenience wrapper around `GetServices("pkg:$?*var=services")`.

## Mutating Services

`AddService`, `SetService`, and `RemoveService` take a **parent dereference URL** — the same `?*var=` form used for reads. The parent identifies the array to read and mutate.

```go
err := app.AddService(newService, "pkg:$?*var=services")
```

Each method first loads the parent array with `GetServices(parent)`, checks name uniqueness or existence, then mutates the mycelium in memory. Call `Save` to persist changes.

### `AddService(record, parent)`

Appends a service with `Graft`. The name must not already exist in the parent array.

```go
err := app.AddService(newService, "pkg:$?*var=services")

// Append to a nested array
err := app.AddService(
    outbound,
    "pkg:$?*var=services[name:auth_proxy].handlers[category:main].outbounds",
)
```

### `SetService(record, parent)`

Replaces an existing service by name with `Inoculate`.

```go
err := app.SetService(updatedService, "pkg:$?*var=services")

// Update a service inside a nested parent
err := app.SetService(
    updatedOutbound,
    "pkg:$?*var=services[name:auth_proxy].handlers[category:main].outbounds",
)
```

### `RemoveService(name, parent)`

Removes a service by name with `Prune`.

```go
err := app.RemoveService("auth_proxy", "pkg:$?*var=services")

// Remove from a nested parent
err := app.RemoveService(
    "old_outbound",
    "pkg:$?*var=services[name:auth_proxy].handlers[category:main].outbounds",
)
```

Underlying mycelium operations use the same dereference paths:

```go
mycelium.Graft("pkg:$?*var=services", newServiceMap)
mycelium.Inoculate("pkg:$?*var=services[name:foo]", newServiceMap)
mycelium.Prune("pkg:$?*var=services[name:foo]")
```

## Services

A `Service` is the unit that gets registered, looked up, started, and referenced by dependencies. Its `name` is the stable identity used by refs such as `"auth_proxy"` or `"auth_proxy/main"`.

The `type` describes the role the service plays in routing:

| `type` | Role |
|--------|------|
| `Independent` | A normal service that handles its own traffic. |
| `Proxy` | A service that forwards commands to inline outbound services. |
| `Extension` | A service used as an extension target in dependency routing. |

Bootstrap fields live on the service, not on each handler, because starting or loading code is a property of the service process/module:

- `module-url` — how to load an inproc handler.
- `start-command` — how to start an IPC handler.

`handler-deps` belongs here when routing is tied to a handler category regardless of command. `parameters` is free-form service metadata and is intentionally not interpreted by this package.

## Handlers

A service may expose multiple handlers because one service can have several entry points: public API, internal API, manager endpoint, publisher, pair socket, and so on. The `category` is the stable label used to choose between those entry points.

In JSON, each `handlers[]` entry is an `IndependentHandler`, `ProxyHandler`, or `ExtensionHandler`. The unmarshaller chooses `ProxyHandler` when proxy routing fields such as `outbounds`, `routes`, or `forward` are present. It chooses `ExtensionHandler` when `inbounds` is present.

`IndependentHandler` is the base shape: protocol type, category, endpoint, and optional command-level dependencies. It represents an endpoint that receives or serves traffic.

`ProxyHandler` embeds the same base shape and adds outbound routing:

- `outbounds` — inline `Service` definitions where proxied traffic may be sent.
- `routes` — optional whitelist of command routes this handler accepts.
- `forward` — optional map from a route to a specific outbound.

Notice: `outbounds` are inline services, not refs. Referenced services may have their own proxies, so following a ref from an outbound would require traversing another topology path to find the final endpoint.

A `Proxy` service must use `ProxyHandler` for every handler in `handlers`.

`ExtensionHandler` embeds the same base shape and adds inbound services:

- `inbounds` — inline `Service` definitions that may call into this extension.

`Extension` services must use `ExtensionHandler` for every handler in `handlers`. `inbounds` follow the same validation rules as proxy `outbounds`.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are declared separately from services so callers describe intent, while targets remain reusable and independently validated.

`DepService` is used in two scopes. In `handler-deps`, `name` is a handler category on the service. In `command-deps`, `name` is a command handled by the parent handler.

| Declared in | `name` means |
|-------------|--------------|
| `handler-deps` | handler category on this service |
| `command-deps` | command name handled by the parent handler |

Each dependency lists proxy targets, extension targets, or both. Proxies are for routed calls through another service. Extensions are for extension-style targets.

`ServicePointer` is the target value in `proxies` and `extensions`. It is either:

- a **ref** to an existing service in `services`, e.g. `"auth_proxy"` or `"auth_proxy/main"`.
- an **inline service** object defined directly in the JSON.

Refs make shared dependencies explicit. Inline services keep private or nested dependencies close to the caller without requiring a top-level service entry.

## Ref Format

Refs point to services declared in the root `services` list.

- `service_name`: references a service.
- `service_name/handler_category`: references one handler category on a service.

Invalid refs include empty strings, trailing slashes, empty service names, and empty path segments such as `"auth_proxy//main"`.

## Endpoint Bootstrap Rules

Endpoint `port` defaults to `0` when omitted.

- `port: 0` with an id starting with `tmp` is IPC and requires `start-command`.
- `port: 0` with any other id is inproc and requires `module-url`.
- non-zero ports do not require bootstrap metadata.
- manager handlers (`category: "manager"`) are ignored when deciding service bootstrap requirements.

## Validation

`Load` calls `ValidateTopology`.

Validation checks service names, service types, handler types, handler categories, endpoint ids, dependency target shape, inline service definitions, and ref existence. If a ref includes a handler category, the referenced service must contain that category.

For `ProxyHandler`, validation also checks outbound targets and verifies that `forward` entries refer to declared routes and outbounds.
